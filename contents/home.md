<p style="text-align:justify"> I am currently working at the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Anhui University. I received my Ph.D degree from the School of Cyber Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2023, supervised by <a href="https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/kpxue" style="color: rgb(57, 115, 142);">Prof. Kaiping Xue</a>. From Jun 2023 to May 2025, I served as a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Information Science and Technology, USTC. My current research interests include quantum networking, distributed quantum computing, and quantum artificial intelligence. So far, I have published more than 20 papers in international journals or conferences, such as IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking(ToN), IEEE Transactions on Communications(TCOM), IEEE Transactions on Network Service and Management(TNSM), IEEE Network, China Communications. In addition, I have been invited many times to be a reviewer for international journals, such as IEEE/ACM ToN, IEEE TCOM, IEEE Network, IEEE TNSM, IEEE TNSE, China Communications, IET Quantum Communications, IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering, and Quantum Information Processing. &#128073 <u>Here are my <a href="static/assets/pdf/resume.pdf" style="color: rgb(57, 115, 142);">resume</a>!</u> </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ If you have a strong passion for doing research on quantum communication and quantum computing, this may be the right place for you. I am particularly interested in self-motivated students who are willing to spend their times here for pursuing a master's degree.
