<p style="text-align:justify"> I am currently an Associate Professor at the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Anhui University. I received my Ph.D degree from the School of Cyber Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2023, supervised by <a href="https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/kpxue">Prof. Kaiping Xue</a>. From 2023 to 2025, I served as a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Information Science and Technology, USTC.  My current research interests include quantum networking, distributed quantum computing, and quantum artificial intelligence. So far, I have published more than 20 papers in international journals or conferences such as IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, IEEE Network, IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (TNSM), China Communications, etc. Besides, I have been invited many times to be a reviewer for international journals such as China Communications, IEEE Network, IEEE TNSM, IET Quantum Communications, IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering (TQE), and Quantum Information Processing. </p>

__Attention:__ If you have a strong passion for doing research on quantum communication and quantum computing, this may be the right place for you. I am particularly interested in self-motivated students who are willing to spend their times here for pursuing a master's degree. If you're interested, please send your resume and transcripts in pdf form to my email leestone@ustc.edu.cn.
